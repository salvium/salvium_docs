# SPARC: Spend Proof and Anonymized Returns for CARROT

## Overview

SPARC (Spend Proof and Anonymized Returns for CARROT) is a cryptographic protocol designed for Salvium cryptocurrency that extends the [CARROT addressing scheme](carrot.md). It solves two critical challenges in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies:

- It enables anonymous refunds/returns while maintaining privacy
- It allows users to prove they control an address without revealing private keys

SPARC is a key innovation that enables Salvium to meet [regulatory requirements](../THE%20PROJECT/Compliance%20Statement.md) while preserving core [privacy features](../THE%20PROTOCOL/About%20Privacy.md).

## Key Components

### Anonymized Returns

SPARC implements a secure return payment system that allows recipients to send funds back to senders without knowing their address:

- **Encrypted Return Data**: When a user sends funds, they can include encrypted return data in the transaction
- **Privacy Preservation**: This return data appears as random noise to outside observers
- **Recipient Capabilities**: Only the intended recipient can recognize and use this return data
- **Return Transactions**: The recipient can send funds back to the original sender without knowing their address
- **Sender Verification**: The original sender can verify returned funds are genuinely for them

This system maintains complete privacy while enabling two-way transactions, solving a fundamental limitation of traditional privacy coins.

### Spend Authority Proof

The spend authority proof is a zero-knowledge proof that demonstrates a user controls an address without revealing their private keys:

- **Zero-Knowledge Property**: Proves knowledge of secret values without revealing them
- **Schnorr-Like Construction**: Based on established cryptographic techniques
- **Security Guarantees**: Satisfies completeness, soundness, and zero-knowledge properties
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Enables verification of address ownership for compliance purposes

This capability is critical for MiCA compliance, allowing exchanges and other regulated entities to verify address control without compromising user privacy.

## Security Properties

SPARC provides formal security guarantees:

- **Indistinguishability**: Transactions with return data are indistinguishable from those without
- **Unlinkability**: Transactions cannot be linked across the blockchain
- **Return Address Hiding**: Return addresses cannot be recovered by third parties
- **Non-Swindling**: Adversaries cannot redirect return funds to themselves
- **Unforgeability**: Proofs cannot be faked without breaking cryptographic assumptions

## Relationship to CARROT

SPARC extends the [CARROT](carrot.md) (Cryptonote Address on Rerandomizable-RingCT-Output Transactions) addressing protocol, which provides:

- **Full view-only wallets**: Monitoring of both incoming and outgoing transactions
- **Forward secrecy**: Protection against future advances in computing
- **Enhanced security**: Protection against various attack vectors

SPARC adds the critical anonymized returns and spend proof capabilities on top of this foundation.

## Practical Applications

SPARC enables various real-world applications:

- **E-commerce & Refunds**: Merchants can issue refunds without storing customer wallet addresses
- **Escrow Systems**: Funds can be returned automatically if conditions aren't met
- **Compliant Exchange Listings**: Exchanges can verify transaction information when required by regulations
- **Private Smart Contracts**: Foundation for complex, private return logic in applications

## Implementation Status

SPARC is being implemented in Salvium, with components that include:

- **Return Address Handling**: Implementation of the return address scheme
- **Proof Generation**: Construction of spend authority proofs
- **Verification Mechanisms**: Systems for verifying proofs and returned funds
- **Wallet Integration**: User interface elements for managing returns and proofs in the [Salvium wallet](../WALLETS/Salvium%20GUI%20Wallet%20Guide.md)

## Quantum Resistance Considerations

SPARC incorporates design elements intended to provide protection against quantum computing threats:

- **Forward Secrecy**: Protection of past transactions even if encryption is broken in the future
- **Modified Cryptographic Constructions**: Adaptations to increase resistance to quantum algorithms
- **Unlinkability**: Prevention of transaction linking that could be vulnerable to quantum analysis

## FAQ

Q: Does using SPARC compromise privacy?  
A: No. SPARC maintains all the privacy guarantees of traditional privacy coins while adding capabilities for returns and regulatory compliance.

Q: How does SPARC differ from Monero's approach?  
A: Monero does not currently implement a return payment system or spend authority proofs. SPARC builds on concepts originally proposed for Monero but not implemented.

Q: Is SPARC's implementation open source?  
A: Yes, the implementation of SPARC in Salvium is fully open source and available for review in our [code repository](../THE%20PROJECT/How%20to%20get%20involved.md).

Q: How does SPARC help with regulatory compliance?  
A: SPARC enables users to prove they control an address without revealing private keys, satisfying regulatory requirements for verification while maintaining privacy.

Q: Does SPARC require changes to the consensus protocol?  
A: SPARC builds on the existing Salvium consensus protocol with additions to [transaction formats](../THE%20PROTOCOL/Protocol_tx.md) and validation rules.
