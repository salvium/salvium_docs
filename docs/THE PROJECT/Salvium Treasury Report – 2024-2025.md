# **Salvium Treasury Report – Interim Update (Q4 2025 YTD)**

This interim report provides a complete summary of treasury activity from **Q4 2024 to Q4 2025 (up to 26 November 2025)**. Regular Treasury Reports were paused during the audit period, so this document provides the missing transparency ahead of the full audited report due after Q4 closes.

During the audit preparation, monthly treasury unlocks were paused. This pause was resolved in **Q3 2025**, and unlocks resumed according to the updated schedule.

## All numbers below come directly from the treasury ledger and are shown as **whole SAL1 values**.

# **Governance Wallet \& Unlock Replacement Plan**

*(Community clarification published 1 November 2025)*

To clarify how unlocks were paused and replaced during the audit process:

* The original governance wallet on the old SAL chain contains **10.4 million SAL**, permanently locked. These coins **cannot be spent**, will never enter circulating supply, and remain in that address in perpetuity.
* To replace those lost SAL coins, Salvium One introduced a schedule of **eight (8) unlock payments of 1.3M SAL1**, spaced 30 days apart from the Salvium One hard fork.
* The governance wallet had last received an audited inflow in **February 2025**, meaning the project was effectively **8 months behind** on its unlock schedule by the time Salvium One went live.
* To correct this backlog, the remaining payments were doubled from **650,000 SAL1 → 1.3M SAL1** for 8 cycles.

### **Why 1.3M × 8 (=10.4M) instead of minting 5.2M at once?**

* Minting 5.2M SAL1 at HF was technically possible (representing 8 missed unlocks × 650k),
* But the team chose the **8 × 1.3M structure** instead because it:

  * maintains the original unlock cadence,
  * avoids a large one-time mint,
  * provides smoother operational funding during the Salvium One transition.

### **Key point**

**The total amount of treasury funding remains identical to what was originally planned. No additional treasury advantage has been created.**

### **Circulating Supply**

Legacy SAL locked in the governance wallet is **not part of circulating supply**. Its SAL1 replacements are minted under the new audited rules.

---

# **Closing Summary**

* Treasury operations continued through the audit pause, but unlock income was interrupted.
* The Salvium One unlock correction restores the intended treasury funding profile without increasing the total coins allocated to operations.
* This interim report fills the gap created during the audit and hard-fork remediation period.
* A full, Treasury Report for **Q4 2025** will be published once the quarter closes and the circulating supply audit finalises.
