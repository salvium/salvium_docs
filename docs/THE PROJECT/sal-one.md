## What is Salvium One?

Salvium One is the culmination of 15 months of development, designed to deliver:

* **Privacy-first transactions** compatible with regulatory compliance
* **Carrot address format** ‚Äì a new address system required for future features
* **SPARC integration** ‚Äì private, anonymised return payments
* **Full DeFi readiness** ‚Äì foundations for private tokens, DEXs, and lending protocols

## Key Features

### Carrot Address System

* New address prefix: `SC1...`
* Enables refundable transactions without revealing sender addresses
* Critical for exchange compliance and interoperability
* Legacy CryptoNote addresses (`SaLv...`) become **invalid at fork**

### SPARC Integration

* Private refund mechanism for exchanges
* Allows returns of unauthorized deposits without exposing transaction history

### T-CLSAG

* Updated version of Monero‚Äôs CLSAG ring signatures
* Maintains anonymity while enabling Carrot address support

### View-Only Wallets

* Full visibility of **incoming and outgoing transactions**
* Meets compliance and audit requirements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Change: Wallet Address Migration

### What Happens at the Fork

* Your wallet will automatically generate a **Carrot address** (`SC1...`)
* Your old CryptoNote address (`SaLv...`) becomes a **legacy address**
* After the fork, only Carrot addresses will be accepted for mining and payouts

Balances remain untouched. You **do not** need to move your coins ‚Äî only update your software and addresses.

### How to Find Your Carrot Address

**1. CLI Wallet v1.0.0 and above**
Open your wallet and you‚Äôll see both the legacy and Carrot addresses displayed, for example:

```
Opened legacy (CN) wallet: SaLvTyKva...
Opened Carrot wallet: SC1TotkUC9...
```

**2. CLI Command**
Run:

```
address 0
```

This will display your primary address in both formats.

**3. RPC (from v1.0.1 onward)**
Use the `get_address` RPC call:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"get_address","params":{"account_index":0}}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Guidance for Miners

* Update your miner config (xmrig, etc.) with your **Carrot address** before the fork
* If you continue mining with a legacy address after block 334750, shares will be rejected
* If supported by your pool, you may enter both old and new addresses during the pre-fork period to ensure a smooth switch

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Guidance for Pools

* Update your pool payout wallet to a Carrot address before the fork
* Accept Carrot addresses only after block 334750. Legacy addresses must be rejected
* Manage unpaid balances:

  * Flush outstanding balances to legacy addresses before the fork, **or**
  * Collect Carrot addresses from miners in advance and map `{old ‚Üí new}` in your DB

**Regex patterns for validation:**

* Legacy:

  ```
  ^(SaLv)[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{94,140}$
  ```

* Carrot:

  ```
  ^(SC1)[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{94,140}$
  ```

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Will my balance change after the fork?**
No. Your coins and balances remain the same. Only the wallet address format changes.

**Do I need to move coins before the fork?**
No. You don‚Äôt need to move anything. Just update your wallet software.

**How can I find my new address?**
Open v1.0.0+ of the CLI wallet, or run `address 0`. RPC users can call `get_address` from v1.0.1.

**What happens if I mine to my old address after the fork?**
Your shares will be rejected. Pools will not accept legacy addresses post-fork.

**I‚Äôm a pool operator. How do I handle unpaid balances?**
Either flush them to old addresses before the fork or collect new Carrot addresses in advance.

**Does this affect staking or SPARC?**
Yes. Both require Carrot addresses. Make sure your infrastructure is updated.
